PacketEvents is an open-source Packet API. It has many cross-version packet-wrappers. You can process incoming and outgoing packets on the server. You can even send packets with our packet-wrappers. We are here to save you a ton of time.

### Statistics
PacketEvents collects statistics anonymously through bStats. Participation is completely optional and you can opt-out at any time, although it is really helpful in figuring out what environments the plugin is running in (i.e. versions of Spigot, Java), so I can adjust development accordingly.

### Credit
PacketEvents uses an injector that is extremely similar to ViaVersion's injector. I have included license and copyright holder notice in the files taken from ViaVersion. Thank you ViaVersion.
